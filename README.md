### Hi there, I am Dinara 👋👩‍💻

I'm a Data Enthusiast based in Berlin. Since 2015, I've played diverse roles – BI specialist, data analyst, and analytics engineer, honing my skills across the analytics spectrum. 

Recently, I've expanded my knowledge base by graduating from a Data Science bootcamp - [Spiced Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/en/program/data-science). 

With expertise in Tableau, Looker, and SQL, and a solid grasp of Python and dbt, I'm on the lookout for opportunities that let me bring my data visualization and analysis skills to the forefront, contributing to data-informed solutions.
